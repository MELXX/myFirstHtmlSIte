			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>We all want to be healthy but we don't put in the effort or we constantly make excuses. 
			   this website will show you that it is not expensive to eat healthy nor is it boring. with proper planning and education you will be on your way to regular healthy eating  </p>

			<h3>Benefits of healthy eating</h3>			
				<ul>
					<li>You will have energy you need to stay active for the duration of the day.</li></br>Unhealthy food puts a huge amount of strain on the human digestive system. Guess what – 
																											we didn’t evolve on a diet of fast food, but rather, we evolved on a diet 
																											high in fruits, vegetables, nuts, fish and red meat
					
					<li>The nutrients, needed for growth and repair,to help you to stay strong and healthy and help to prevent diet-related illness will be in your diet.</li>
					<li>Strong bones and teeth</li>

					<li>Learn to cook</li></br>If you’re always buying processed, pre-made food, how will you ever learn to cook? Get down to your fruit and 
												veg store and get some ingredients. Go home to your kitchen and cook up a storm – just for the hell of it. By aiming to be healthy,
												you’ll learn how to cook a wide variety of things.
					
					<li>Save money</li></br>In the short term, one of the benefits of healthy eating is that it’s so cheap! Eating out, or buying lots of packaged, processed food is one quick way to run out of cash. You’ll also save money in the long term,
											as you’ll be out playing tennis and being awesome while other
											people spend their days seeing doctors and other medical personnel.</br>
					<li>Enhanced mood</li>
					<li>Heart health</li>
					<li>Better employee</li>
					
					<li>Prevent and/or manage diabetes. </br>Type 2 diabetes is associated with
							the excessive consumption of high GI foods and foods that contain too
							much fat. Balanced, low GI diets can help prevent this type of diabetes, as
							well as manage type 1 diabetes, which usually has a genetic component.</li>
					
				</ul>
				
			<h3>Misconceptions about healthy eating</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>Carbs are Evil</br>
						If I could eliminate one nutritional misconception from people’s minds, this would be it. Hands down. People have such weird issues with carbs. 
						Part of me understands, because your daily intake of refined carbohydrates should be limited — and 
						ketogenic diets can certainly prove beneficial for certain individuals. But what about fruits, 
						vegetables, and the much-maligned but totally nutritious white potato?
					</li></br>					
					<li>Run away from fat!</br>
						Healthy fats are such a vital component of a healthy diet; in fact, these satiating macronutrients should comprise roughly 
						30% of your daily caloric intake. Avocados, olive oil, and natural peanut butter all make you feel full while keeping your skin, hair, and nails looking their best. So go ahead — 
						pay extra for that side of guac. In fact, consider it a beauty treatment.
					</li></br>
					<li>
						Organic Food is Always Best</br>
						Hey, I’ve seen organic gummy bears, so let’s not pretend that an organic label means that snack food is super nutritious. Buying organic fruits and vegetables is a great way to avoid pesticides, 
						but mindlessly indulging in organic candy won’t do anything for your health or your waistline
					</li></br>
					<li>
						Fresh Produce is More Nutritious</br>
						When fruits and vegetables are first harvested, they are healthier — but those benefits begin to fade as they slowly make their way into your local grocery store. 
						On the other hand, frozen and canned produce is packaged right after it’s sourced, so the nutrients are sealed in as a result. That means you’re probably better 
						off eating canned carrots than those “fresh” ones you bought three days ago. Who knew?
					</li></br>
					<li>
						Salt Should Be Restricted</br>
						The salt myth is still alive and kicking, even though there has never been any good scientific support for it.
						Although lowering salt can reduce blood pressure, it doesn't have any effect on heart attacks, strokes or death.
						Of course, if you have a medical condition like salt-sensitive hypertension then you may be an exception.
						But the public health advice that everyone should lower their salt intake (and have to eat boring, tasteless food) is not based on evidence.
					</li></br>
					<li>Egg Yolks Should Be Avoided Because They Are High in Cholesterol, Which leads to Heart Disease</br>
						We've been advised to cut back on whole eggs because the yolks are high in cholesterol.
						However, cholesterol in the diet has remarkably little effect on cholesterol in the blood, at least for the majority of people.
						Studies have shown that eggs raise the "good" choleserol and don't raise risk of heart disease.				
						Whole eggs really are among the most nutritious foods on the planet and almost all the nutrients are found in the yolks.
					</li></br>
					<li>Saturated Fat Raises bad Cholesterol in the Blood, Increasing Risk of Heart Attacks</br>
					For decades, we've been told that saturated fat raises cholesterol and causes heart disease. 
					However, saturated fat is not linked to an increased risk of death from heart disease or stroke.
					The truth is that saturated fats raise good cholesterol and change the LDL (bad choleserol) particles from small to Large LDL, which is linked to reduced risk.
					For most people, eating reasonable amounts of saturated fat is perfectly safe and downright healthy.
					</li></br>
					<li>
						All Calories Are Created Equal, It Doesn't Matter Which Types of Foods They Are Coming From</br>
						This is simply false as different foods go through different processes and have direct effects on bodily functions that regulate appetite.
						There are many more examples of different foods having vastly different effects on hunger, hormones and health. Because a calorie is not a calorie.
					</li></br>
					<li>Low-Fat Foods Are Healthy Because They Are Lower in Calories and Saturated Fat</br>
						When the low-fat guidelines came out,food manufacturers came up with all sorts of low-fat "healthy foods". The problem is these foods taste horrible 
						when the fat is removed, so the food manufacturers added a huge mass of sugar instead.
						Excess sugar is incredibly harmful, while the fat naturally present in food is not.					
					</li></br>
