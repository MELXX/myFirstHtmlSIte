			<h3>Additives</h3>
			<p>
				<strong>What Is a Food Additive?</strong></br>
					In its broadest sense, a food additive is any substance added to food. Legally, the
					term refers to “any substance the intended use of which results or may reasonably be expected to result directly or indirectly
					in its becoming a component or otherwise affecting the characteristics of any
					food.” This definition includes any substance used in the production, processing,
					treatment, packaging, transportation or storage of food.

				<h3>Types of additives to avoid</h3>
				    <p>Aspartame</br>This is an artificial sweetener that is used to replace sugars in foods and beverages.</p>
					<p>Benzoate</br>Used as a food colouring and preservative in foods. Children who consumed a mixture of food colourings and preservatives from soft drinks and 
										confectionery at high levels were found to be more hyperactive than those who did not.</p>
					<p>Monosodium glutamate (MSG)</br>is often added to food as a flavour enhancer but it can also occur naturally in food. While in the past MSG has been implicated as the causative agent of 
															Chinese restaurant syndrome and asthmatic attacks there is insufficient evidence to support this at the levels consumed in food.</p>
					<p>Nitrates</br>Nitrite has been implicated in a variety of long term health effects, including gastric cancer.</p>
					<p>Sulphite</br>Manifestations of sulphite sensitivity include anaphylaxis and asthma.</p>
					<p>Tartrazine</br>Tartrazine has been implicated in the aggravation of both asthma and chronic urticaria in some people.</p>
				<h3>Toxic food ingredients</h3>
					<p>Palm Oil</p>
					<p>Shortening</p>
					<p>White Flour, Rice, Pasta, and Bread</p>
					<p>Sodium Benzoate and Potassium Benzoate</p>
